# Prototypes and Classes in Javascript

## Description

This is for demonstration purposes. 

The main branch of this repo uses two prototype constructors, each with it's own method. A simple form can take a name and create both objects, with one set as a property of the other. You can click the buttons to call their methods. 

The parent-child branch has examples of similar functionality using ES6 classes.
